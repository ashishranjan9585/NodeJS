// Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, It is a process of confirming whether the user is genuine or not.
// Browser make a request to the server, server checks if the user is valid or not, if valid then it sends the response back to the browser by sending a token(long string).
// Token is store in the local storage of the browser.
// After successful login, in every request, the token is sent to the server, The server does not check the username and password again, it only checks the token.

//1. Hashing - It is a process of converting a given key into another value. It is a one-way function, means once the key is hashed, it cannot be converted back to the original key.
//2. Encryption -> It is the converting a given key into another value. It is a two-way function, means once the key is encrypted, it can be converted back to the original key.
//3. JSON web Token(JWT) - It is a standard for creating access tokens that assert some number of claims. Token is store in the local storage of the browser(Application -> Local Storage).
   //For example , a server could generate a token that has the claim "logged in as admin" and provide that to a client.
   // The client could then use that token to prove that it is logged in as admin. The tokens are signed by the server's key, so the server is able to verify that the token is legitimate. The tokens are designed to be compact, URL-safe,
   //and usable especially in a web-browser single sign-in (SSO) context. JWT claims can be typically used to pass identify of authenticated users between provider and a service provider, or any other type of claims as required by bussiness processes.
//4. Local storage - It is a web storage object that allows data to be stored in the browser with no expiration date. The data will not be deleted when the browser is closed, and wil be available the next day, week , or year.


//  Write a simple express server that has the following endpoints:
// 1. POST /signin - It takes a username and password in the request body and returns a JWT token if the user exists in the in memory database.
// 2. GET /users - It returns a list of users if the JWT token is valid. The list of users should not include the user whose token was used to make the request.
